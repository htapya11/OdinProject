        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A classic pan-seared steak, seasoned with salt and pepper, cooked to your desired doneness in a hot skillet with olive oil and butter, and optionally flavored with garlic and fresh herbs.</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 ribeye or New York strip steaks, about 1 inch thick</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Take the steaks out of the refrigerator about 30 minutes before cooking to bring them to room temperature.</li>
            <li>Pat the steaks dry with paper towels and season generously with salt and pepper on both sides.</li>
            <li>Heat a heavy skillet (preferably cast iron) over medium-high heat until very hot, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Flip the steaks and add the butter, garlic cloves, and thyme or rosemary to the skillet. Tilt the skillet slightly and use a spoon to continually baste the steaks with the melted butter for another 4-5 minutes, or until the steak reaches your desired doneness.</li>
            <li>Remove the steaks from the skillet and let them rest on a cutting board or plate for 5 minutes before serving. This allows the juices to redistribute.</li>
            <li>Serve the steaks whole or sliced, drizzled with any remaining butter from the skillet.</li>
        </ol>
