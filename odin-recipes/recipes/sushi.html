        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Sushi is a traditional Japanese dish consisting of vinegared rice, usually served with raw fish or other seafood, and sometimes vegetables, rolled in seaweed (nori) or served as bite-sized pieces.</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Sushi rice</li>
            <li>Nori seaweed sheets</li>
            <li>Chicken, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>Vegetables (e.g., cucumber, avocado, carrot), thinly sliced or julienned</li>
            <li>Soy sauce</li>
            <li>Wasabi and pickled ginger</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place a bamboo sushi mat on a clean surface and cover it with plastic wrap.</li>
            <li>Lay a sheet of nori, shiny side down, on the plastic wrap.</li>
            <li>Wet your hands with water and grab a handful of sushi rice. Spread the rice evenly over the nori, leaving about 1 inch of nori uncovered at the top edge.</li>
            <li>Arrange your choice of meat and vegetables horizontally across the center of the rice.</li>
            <li>Using the bamboo mat, roll the sushi away from you, applying gentle pressure to compact the ingredients into a tight cylinder. Lift the mat as you roll to help shape the sushi roll.</li>
            <li>Once rolled, use a sharp knife to slice the roll into 6-8 pieces.</li>
        </ol>
